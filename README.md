# JWST-Inference
JWST-Inference is a simple inference repository containing simple HOD model to describe the clustering and UV LF that is calculated consistently.

#GOAL OF THE PROJECT

Goal of the project is to use existing observations of JWST UV LFs at high redshifts ($z$ > $7-8$) companioned with the clustering information to constrain stochastic astrophysical scaling relations. Clustering is done using a simple HOD that is consistent with the astrophysical model presented in [NikoliÄ‡+24]()
