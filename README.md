# JWST-Inference
JWST-Inference is a simple inference repository containing simple HOD model to describe the clustering and UV LF that is calculated consistently.

# GOAL OF THE PROJECT

Goal of the project is to use existing observations of JWST UV LFs at high redshifts ($z$ > $7-8$) companioned with the clustering information to constrain stochastic astrophysical scaling relations. Clustering is done using a simple HOD that is consistent with the astrophysical model presented in [NikoliÄ‡+24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15237) and developed in [Stochasticity_Sampler](https://github.com/IvanNikolic21/Stochasticity_sampler). This astrophysical model is also used for the modeling of the JWST UVLFs. This consistent modeling is then combined in an MCMC algorithm to constrain a number of astrophysical parameters. <br\> The list of observations available and used is listed here:
